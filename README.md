# The Cosmic Phi Matrix: Domain-Specific Golden Ratio Constants from Stellar Geometry

This repository contains the foundational research and mathematical framework for decoding domain-specific golden ratio constants from stellar constellation geometries using the **Universal Geometric Decoder (UGD)**. The system is assumption-free, bidirectional, and dimensionally scalable‚Äîextracting polynomial identities directly from angular stellar relationships.

## üìê Core Components

- **UGD Algorithm**: Bidirectional mapping from stellar coordinates to polynomial identities.
- **13-Constellation Phi Matrix**: Domain-specific phi constants derived from zodiacal constellations plus Ophiuchus.
- **Cosmic Phi Identity**: Fourth-degree polynomial from Virgo yielding $\phi_{\text{cosmic}} = 1.6282$.
- **Master Integration Constant**: Ophiuchus-derived $\phi_{\text{master}} = 1.6236$ satisfying recursive averaging.

## üìä Applications

- Quantum coherence optimization  
- Biological resonance mapping  
- Cosmological structure modeling  
- Phi-optimized engineering and computation
