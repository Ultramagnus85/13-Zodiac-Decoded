**Abstract** – The *Universal Geometric Decoder (UGD)* extracts **13 distinct golden-ratio (\(\phi\)) constants** from the angular relationships of the 13 zodiac constellations (including Ophiuchus). Each \(\phi_d\) is calibrated to a physical scale—quantum, biological, or cosmic—with Ophiuchus providing the *master integration constant* \(\phi_{\text{master}} = 1.6236\).

## Core Components
- **UGD Algorithm** – Assumption-free, bidirectional mapper from stellar angles to polynomial identities.  
- **13-Constellation Phi Matrix** – One \(\phi_d\) per sign, plus the master key.  
- **Cosmic Phi Identity** – Fourth-degree polynomial from Virgo yields the universal baseline \(\phi_{\text{cosmic}} = 1.6180339887\ldots\).

## Applications
- Quantum coherence tuning  
- DNA / neural resonance mapping  
- Galaxy-formation simulations  
- Phi-optimized engineering & AI
